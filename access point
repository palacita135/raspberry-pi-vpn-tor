While typing out this command, there are a few details that you must replace with your own.

<DEVICE>: This is the device name assigned to your Raspberry Pi’s Wi-Fi adapter. In the vast majority of cases, this should be “wlan0“.
<SSID>: Replace this placeholder with the name you want broadcast by your access point. It is the ID that will be used by others when connecting to your hotspot.
<PASSWORD>: The last value you must replace is the password that will be used to secure your Raspberry Pi’s Wi-Fi access point.

sudo nmcli d wifi hotspot ifname <DEVICE> ssid <SSID> password <PASSWORD>

nmcli con show
nmcli dev wifi show-password
